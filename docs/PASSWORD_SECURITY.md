# Password Security Improvements

This document describes the security improvements implemented for password handling in our application.

## Overview

We have upgraded our password hashing from SHA-256 to PBKDF2, which is specifically designed for secure password storage and is compatible with Expo/React Native. This change significantly enhances the security of user passwords in our application.

## Improvements

### 1. Switched from SHA-256 to PBKDF2

- **Before**: We were using SHA-256 hash algorithm without salting
- **After**: We now use PBKDF2 with the following security benefits:
  - Automatic salt generation (16 random bytes) for each password
  - Configurable iterations (set to 10,000) to slow down brute force attacks
  - Built-in protection against rainbow table attacks
  - Full compatibility with Expo/React Native

### 2. Implemented a Migration Strategy

A seamless migration path was added to handle existing users:

- When users log in, we first attempt to validate their password using PBKDF2
- If that fails, we try the old SHA-256 validation method
- If the password is valid with SHA-256, we automatically upgrade their hash to PBKDF2
- The user experiences no disruption during this process
- Also handles migration from any bcrypt-formatted passwords that may exist during development

### 3. Updated All Password Operations

All password-related functions have been updated to use PBKDF2:

- `hashPassword`: Now generates proper PBKDF2 hashes with salting
- `validatePassword`: Now properly validates against PBKDF2 hashes
- `resetPassword`: Uses the new PBKDF2 hashing
- `signUp`: Creates new users with secure PBKDF2 hashes

### 4. Migration Script Updated

The migration script that transfers users from Supabase Auth to a custom users table has been updated to use PBKDF2 for all new accounts.

## Technical Implementation

### PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2)

We've implemented PBKDF2 using the expo-crypto library:

- Iterative application of SHA-256 to the password+salt
- 10,000 iterations for production use (slows down brute force attacks)
- 16-byte random salt for protection against rainbow tables
- 32-byte output key length

### Compatibility

This implementation is compatible with:

- Expo applications (using only expo-crypto, no Node.js dependencies)
- React Native applications
- Web applications via Expo Web
- All major platforms (iOS, Android, Web)

## Future Improvements

While PBKDF2 is a significant upgrade, here are some potential future security enhancements:

1. Consider implementing Argon2id when it becomes available in React Native/Expo
2. Add two-factor authentication for additional security
3. Implement account lockout after failed login attempts
4. Set up regular password rotation policies for sensitive accounts

## Testing

The PBKDF2 implementation has been tested to ensure:

- Correct password hashing
- Proper validation of correct passwords
- Rejection of incorrect passwords
- Seamless migration from SHA-256 to PBKDF2
- Proper handling of edge cases like malformed hashes
